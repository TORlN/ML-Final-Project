    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "I will be using the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle, which contains medical records with the following key characteristics:\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: Presence of heart disease (0 = no disease, 1 = disease)\n",
    "- **Features**: Various medical measurements and patient demographics\n",
    "- **Problem Type**: Binary Classification\n",
